        <h2>About Me And My Hobby</h2>    
            <p>My name is Erika Borrali and I reside in San Francisco for almost 23 years.  I'm a mom of two beautiful kids ages 6 and 8 years old.  My hobby is to go hiking.  I enjoy hiking because I like walking on uneven terrains, watch out for rocks, branches, and other obstacles, as well as observing nature. It helps me physically and mentally as well.  Also, it helps my kids stay active and moving. make the hike interactive with a nature-themed scavenger hunt or a hike to a cool feature, like a waterfall.</p>
