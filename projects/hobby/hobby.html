                <h2>Details To Go Hiking:</h2>
                    <p><em>To start your hiking hobby</em>, the only skill you need is the ability to walk. Just place one foot in front of the other to hike. Just find a short, easy trail nearby and go hiking. The shoes you wear are very important as it can lead to sore feet and a short hike. Terrain shoes are the best, but light hiking shoes are just fine.The pants to wear for a hike are the ones that are breathable and help keep you cool or warm depending on the temperature.  Don't wear denim jeans when hiking, as they can be uncomfortable.</P>
